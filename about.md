> The **infinite monkey theorem** states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times.

I'm a French software engineer, you can find me on:

- [Github](https://github.com/youribonnaffe) where I sometime share personal projects and contribute to OSS
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youribonnaffe/) where you can find out my current job

_This is a not a blog_ is the sense I do not intend to frequently post content, but I just 
wanted to share content online while avoiding the paywalls.
